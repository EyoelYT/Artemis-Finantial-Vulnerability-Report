# Artemis-Finantial-Vulnerability-Report

Artemis Financial, the client, consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers, want to modernize their operations. They want to use the most current and effective software security. This would be applied to a public web interface. One of their goals with this is to protect their customer data and financial information. 

Specifically, Artemis Financial wants to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications. When the web application is used to transfer data, it will need a data verification step in the form of a checksum. Additionally, they would like to remove all vulnerabilities in the dependencies of their codebase.

This vulnerability report focuses on identifying and addressing any security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financialâ€™s software. After the evaluation of their software, I was able to update and patch all software vulnerabilities. Additionally, I was able to apply SHA-256 encryption to any communication between the client and the server. 

Applying industry standard best practices contributes enormously to a company by reducing the risk of security breaches, increasing the trust of customers, contributing to the reputation of the company, saving costs by fixing issues early, and promoting anti-disruptive and smooth operations

A challenge that surpassed while working on this report was self-signing a certificate signature. The commands were a bit confusing to understand (such as 'alias'). I understood it once I took the time to understand its documentation through trial and error.

I would increase the layers of security on such software by refactoring following the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow. I would check the following in order: Basic Architecture -> Input Validation -> API interactions -> Cryptography -> Compositions of Client / Server -> Code Errors -> Code Quality -> Effective Encapsulation

The Maven-Dependency-Check by Owasp was very helpful in the detection, analysis, and removal of dependency vulnerabilities. A repetitive code review was done to ensure code security and quality.
